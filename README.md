# Nuclei-profiling
This framework provides a graphical representation for atomic nuclei and facilitates the study of their physics.

## What to do with it
The primary goal of this framework is to provide a convenient and intuitive graphical representation of the nuclear structure. It offers a range of features that enable users to visualize and analyze the properties of nuclei.

One of the key functionalities is the ability to generate graphical representations of nucleon density distributions. This allows users to gain insights into the spatial distribution of nucleons within the nucleus. Furthermore, the framework is designed to be flexible and extensible. Additional features and capabilities may be added in the future, enhancing its functionality and providing users with even more tools for nuclear structure analysis.

### Features

* Create and illustrate atomic nuclei with intrinsic deformation
* Create density renderings of the nuclei based on the Wood-Saxon profile
* Rotate the nuclei in three dimensions
* Create projection of the nuclei in the transverse plane


### Requirements

* Python (version 3.11.3), only version tested 
* Required dependencies: Plotly, numpy
